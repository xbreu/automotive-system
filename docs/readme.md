# Automotive System

## Goal

The goal of the project is to explore the validation and verification of a realistic safety-critical software system during the design and implementation stages of development.

It has two main parts:
- Model and analyse the design of a critical system using Alloy;

## Problem

The problem is based on a real-life [case study](https://abz2021.uni-ulm.de/case-study) made by [ABZ conference](https://abz-conf.org/). Its specification can be found [here](./specification.pdf).

## Context

This project was made by [Alexandre Abreu](https://github.com/xbreu) and [Breno Accioly](https://github.com/BrenoAccioly) for the [Formal Methods for Critical Systems](https://github.com/xbreu/formal-methods/blob/main/docs/readme.md) course at FEUP in 2021/2022.
